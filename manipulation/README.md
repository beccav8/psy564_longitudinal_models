`./manipulation/` Directory
=========

Files in this directory manipulate/groom/munge project data.  The resulting "derived" datasets produce less friction when analyzing.  By centralizing most (and ideally all) of the manipulation code in one place, it's easier to determine how the data was changed before analyzing.  It also reduces duplication of manipulation code, so analyses in different files are more consistent and understandable.

To reproduce the analyses for the appropriate data set, follow the instructions on [manipulation/map/README.md](https://github.com/IALSA/cognition-stress-activity/blob/master/manipulation/map/README.md) for the **MAP** data set and [manipulation/obas/README.md](https://github.com/IALSA/cognition-stress-activity/blob/master/manipulation/obas/README.md) for the **OBAS** data set.
